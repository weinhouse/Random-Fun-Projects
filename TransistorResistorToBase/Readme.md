This project was to document how to choose resister between microcontroller and the Base pin of a transistor

Here is a document with diagrams and formulas: [Test NPN transistor](NPNresistanceToBaseTest.pdf")
Here is a nice video that helped me with this: [Base Resistor Selection using as a switch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv90-yhs0vI)
