### PIR (Passive Infra Red) Project
This was a fun project and I'm using it in my shed. After learning that the PIR device can output 3.3 volt signal and would not require micro processor to switch a relay, I thought it would be a nice addition to my shed to walk in and turn on overhead lights. Here is my first prototype:

This worked ok, but I've been working on prototype packaging and wanted to make this better. I also wanted to use a cheap relay which would require a bit more circuitry. The PIR does not have enough amps to drive the relay so I needed to add a transistor as a switch. I've included some [notes](https://github.com/weinhouse/home/blob/master/pir/NotesAndDocs.pdf) in this repo and some various images. Other supporting info can be found on the Internet.

Here is second prototype which I plan to use in my shed :-)
